# Masternode Configuration - Hot Wallet Guide for Windows Version: 7, 8, 10.

## Prerequisites:
1.	10,000 EXT (Exsolution) Tokens
2.	Exsolution wallet for Windows


This guide is for setting up a hot Exsolution masternode. You will require a Windows PC with internet connection and a unique IP on 24/7

## Download Exsolution wallet
Download the latest Windows Exsolution wallet from our official website: https://github.com/exsolution/ext-wallet/releases/

## Install Exsolution wallet
Run the Exsolution wallet installation file `exsolution-1.1.0-win64-setup.exe`. The default installation folder for the Exsolution wallet is `C:\Program Files\Exsolution`. Click next to continue the installation. After the installation is ready click on finished and start the Exsolution wallet. The default directory where your data and `wallet.dat` will be stored is `C:\Users\YOUR_USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\Exsolution`

## Create masternode public address
You need to create a unique receiving address for your masternode. A receiving address can be created in the wallet by selecting Receiving addresss… from File in the top left side of the wallet. Select New Address , enter an appropriate name (for example MN1) and click on OK to create a new receiving address.

## Generate masternode key
You need to create a unique masternode key for your masternode. This key is generated by the local wallet. The key does not allow any access to collateral or coins earned so it is not a security concern but best practice is to keep it private.
To generate masternode keys, select Tools -> Debug window -> Console
In the debug console type masternode genkey in order to generate a unique masternode key. Record these details for later use.

## Transfer 10,000 EXT to your masternode public address
To allow your masternode to start you need to send 10,000 EXT  to the masternode address in your local wallet, as generated in Step 3 (MN1) that you intend to operate. The transaction needs to be exactly 10,000 EXT. When you make this transaction, ensure that you factor in fees. The windows wallet will show you the total amount being deposited so ensure this reads exactly 10,000 EXT in a single transaction to the masternode address that you intend to operate.

## Record the transaction and output ID
The transaction and output ID from the deposit you made into your masternode public address will need to be added to the masternode configuration file later on. Fetching this information now will make things a bit easier when we reach that stage. To get the transaction and output ID, go to Tools -> Debug window -> Console. In the debug console type masternode outputs and the transaction and output ID will be displayed. If there is no output, you have probably misread Step 5 of this guide. Record these details for later use.

## Edit the exsolution.conf  file
Now we will setup the Masternode. Go to Tools -> Open wallet configuration File.
Paste the following configuration settings into the editor:
```
masternode=1
masternodeprivkey=[MASTERNODEPRIVKEY]
externalip=[EXTERNALIP]
port=21527
rpcuser=[RPCUSER]
rpcpassword=[RPCPASSWORD]
rpcport=21636
rpcallowip=127.0.0.1
daemon=1
server=1
staking=0
listenonion=0
Replace the following:
[MASTERNODEPRIVKEY]: Generated during the Windows Wallet setup in step 4.
[EXTERNALIP]: Set this to your servers public IP address.
[RPCUSER]: Set this to a custom username.
[RPCPASSWORD]: Set this to a STRONG password.
```

:warning: NOTE: Make sure port 21636 is allowed by your firewall.

## Edit the masternode.conf file
Go to Tools -> Open masternode configuration File

Add a new line with masternode config information:
```
MasternodeName  YOUR-IP:21636 masternodeprivkey collateral_output_txid collateral_output_index
```

It should look something like this:
```
MN1 127.0.0.2:21636 93HaYBVUCYjEMeeH1Y4sBGLALQZE1Yc1K64xiqgX37tGBDQL8Xg 2bcd3c84c84f87eaa86e4e56834c92927a07f9e18718810b92e0d0324456a67c 0
```

And save the masternode.conf file

## Final steps
Restart the wallet, go to the masternodes tab on the wallet and click Start all. Wait around 30 minutes or so and the masternode status will update to enabled


# FAQs

- How can I check that my masternode is still activated?
You may check the masternode tab in your wallet
Be careful to make sure you are fully sync’d when checking the tab as restarting a node that is running will reset the timer and the rewards
The best way to check is to look at the full masternode list and filter your node out.
